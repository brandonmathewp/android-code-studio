### Notes
- The Kotlin language server internals have been updated. To ensure a smooth experience, navigate to `Preferences -> Editor -> Language Server Protocol -> Kotlin -> Kotlin Language Server`, uninstall the existing version, and then install the updated one using the download button or by opening any Kotlin project.

- The Clang language server will prompt for installation automatically when you open a project containing C/C++ files.  
  For removal, you may run the following command in a terminal:  
  ```bash
  apt purge clang -y && apt autoremove -y
  ```

- The AI autocompletion feature is experimental. Additional refinements will be delivered in upcoming releases.

- Regarding issue reporting in the ACS repository:  
  Do not submit issues unrelated to ACS.  
  Do not open GitHub issues for casual discussions; instead, use the discussion group at https://t.me/acs_x.  
  Do not report errors or issues from your own projects; such submissions will be removed or ignored.

- Several user-requested features are planned for the next update.

### Scheduled for Next Update
**Reason:** These items were planned for this release but could not be completed due to limited time and exam workload. They are scheduled for implementation in v1.0.0+gh.r4.

1. Rework the code editor to better handle large files (15 KB – 100 KB).  
2. Complete the Asset Studio implementation.  
3. Expand Google layout support and improve UI Designer rendering for additional view types.  
4. Implement a number of user-requested features and fixes.
